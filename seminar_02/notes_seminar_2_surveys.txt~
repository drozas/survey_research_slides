Survey 1 (Mental illness):
============================
Part A) Key concepts

#What is the population?

English adults 16+, living in households

#What type of sampling strategy was used: probability or non-probability?

A combination of both: non-probability for the individuals (quotas, based on sex and working status), probability for the location. For the location, this seems clustered one to me (based on locations).
The reference to "leave three doors", seems like an attempt to "sytematic", but still quotas.

#Was there any information regarding response rates provided?

In this case it is not possible, since it is based on quotas. 

#Could you discuss some possible sources of non-sampling error (e.g. non-response)? [skip if too advanced]

In this case, since it is not a probability one, a main critique would be based on the possible bias on selecting introduced by the interviewers.


Part B) Critically discuss sampling strategy

# Could this strategy has affected the response rate?

# Might another strategy have been more appropriate?


@TO-ASK-ALEX


# Could another sampling strategy have lead to different results?

Survey 2 (Youth):
============================
Part A)

#What is the population?

The population in this case is the set of households (units) within the whole of the UK.

#What type of sampling strategy was used: probability or non-probability?

Probability. Based on several stages, combining stratification and clustering. The clustering is performed by postal sectors. Then, it is stratified (and boosted) according to the presence of a minority ethnic group in the household. 

#Was there any information regarding response rates provided?

Yes, it is indicated by waves:
W1: 57.2%,
W2: +80%
W3: +90%

#Could you discuss some possible sources of non-sampling error (e.g. non-response)? [skip if too advanced]

According to what it is explained in the text (p.13), the fact that it is multi-purpose usually decreases the rate. Possible ways to solve this? @TO-ASK-ALEX


Part B) Critically discuss sampling strategy

# Could this strategy has affected the response rate?

@TO-ASK-ALEX


# Might another strategy have been more appropriate?

# Could another sampling strategy have lead to different results?

Survey 3 (Young people and alcohol):
====================================
Part A)

#What is the population?

Students in Year 9 and Year 11 in secondary schools in England.

#What type of sampling strategy was used: probability or non-probability?

Probability. Stratified by Government office region, school type and free school meals

#Was there any information regarding response rates provided?

I could not find any (@TO-ASK Alex)

#Could you discuss some possible sources of non-sampling error (e.g. non-response)? [skip if too advanced]

According to what it is explained in the text (p.13), the fact that it is multi-purpose usually decreases the rate. Possible ways to solve this?
